## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Q: Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

A: Initially, I was confused as to the function writing method because I am new to Swift. But eventually, I went through multiple Youtube videos to  grab a basic understanding and functionalities of the Swift language.


Q: Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps

A: 

Favorite Application 1: Instagram
Features: Flexibility with choosing music in both personal and business accounts, Close Friends and Hide feature to filter out people who you do not want to share content with

Favorite Application 2: TikTok
Features: Personalized feed content in "For You" page, Collaborating with other creators using Duet/Stitch features

Favorite Application 3: Pinterest
Features: Tailored content or pins according to my search suggestions/content preferences, UI/UX versatility with creating personalized moodboards. 

Q:Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

A: I want to build an app called "Crepe Finder" that integrates a map to locate crepe shops near me or at a certain radius from me. There will be an option to fix the radius. There will also be filters to filter out crepe places with certain food choices such as Halal, Vegetarian, Vegan or Kosher. I also plan to implement fun and beautiful graphics to make the app more interactive.
